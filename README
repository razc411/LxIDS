A simple IPS system for Linux. Watches multiple user specified files for
user specified rules. These rules include the ability to create permanent and temporary 
ip bans.

main.rb - the central ruby script for the IPS, run this to start the IPS

install.script - the installation script for the application, must be run as a super user
	installs the script directly into the crontab so it starts every time you reboot

rules.cfg - the modifiable rules file for the IPS system. Parsed for rules to watch for.

Created using Ruby.
